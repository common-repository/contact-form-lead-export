== Frequently Asked Questions ==
1.  I don't see any `Download File` button on my `Contact Export` page in wp-admin?
        If no Contact Form 7 submissions have occurred since installation of the Contact Form 7 Lead Export plugin, the `Download File` button will be disabled and replaced with the message `No New Leads Have Been Submitted Since Installation of this Plugin`. If you have in fact tested submitting one of your contact forms and after refreshing the wp-admin page you still do not see the `Download File` button, please submit a support request on the forum.

2.   Is there any way to export Contact Form 7 Leads submitted BEFORE I installed the Contact Form 7 Lead Export plugin?
        Currently, there is no functionality to export past leads. Look for this potential feature in future versions/releases of this plugin.
